# IFTTT_Service
A basic example of how to create a IFTTT trigger service with ASP.NET Core 2.1, which passes all of the endpoint tests on their verification tool.  

Make sure you replace the IFTTT_Service_Key within appsettings.json, and update the primary controller endpoint to match the trigger name that you setup on IFTTT.
